We started a tradition years ago when we were first married.  We wanted to make birthdays special. We had our children choose their favorite meals and flavor of cake for their special day. We had gifts and also went around the family and told the person whose birthday it was why we loved them. Everyone loved and looked forward to their special day! As time passed we realized that we needed to do the same for the Savior (an important member of our family). So a new “Christmas tradition” began. On Christmas Day we have a birthday party for Jesus.  We have a special meal, cake for Him (generally peppermint chocolate cheesecake), sing happy birthday to Him and give Him gifts.  We also share with each other why we love Him. The gifts we individually choose are like...reading the Book of Mormon each day, being kind to our siblings, repenting each day, improving our prayers, not hitting etc.  We write down the gifts and put them in a special box and refer to them during the year occasionally.  The next year, we read the gifts we gave the previous year before deciding on our new gift.  This tradition has continued through the years even though our children all have children of their own.  When we served our missions, we still all e-mailed our gifts to each other.  It has been a wonderful way to focus on the Savior on Christmas Day.
