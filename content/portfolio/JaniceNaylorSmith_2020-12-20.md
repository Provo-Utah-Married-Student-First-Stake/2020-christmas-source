Another thing that we created to help celebrate the true meaning of Christmas when our children were little was a Nativity Advent Calendar. I could not find a commercially made calendar for this purpose at the time and so I made my own. This provided another good way to focus our Christmas celebration on the Savior for our family as they were growing up.  Our children would take turns each day putting something on the calendar from the date pockets below.  The baby Jesus is the last person from the Nativity Story to be put on the Calendar on Christmas Eve.
