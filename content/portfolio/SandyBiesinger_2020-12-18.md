I love seeing the beautiful nativities that people display this time of year. While admiring one of my daughters nativities I noticed how our 5 year old granddaughter, Riley, quietly and on her own gave baby Jesus a tender heartfelt gift of one of her stuffed animals and a toy block with her initial on it, both beloved possessions. This expression of love and giving made me ask myself the question: What am I giving to my Savior?
