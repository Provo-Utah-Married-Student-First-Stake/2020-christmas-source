      <description>“Away in a Manger” is one of my favorite Christmas hymns, especially the beginning of the third verse:
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
I’m so grateful that our Savior was born and that He lives again. Merry Christmas!

      <description>Another thing that we created to help celebrate the true meaning of Christmas when our children were little was a Nativity Advent Calendar. I could not find a commercially made calendar for this purpose at the time and so I made my own. This provided another good way to focus our Christmas celebration on the Savior for our family as they were growing up. Our children would take turns each day putting something on the calendar from the date pockets below.</description>

      <description>I love this Christmas story. It reminds me of the power of Christ to change my life if I will let Him. I am so thankful to God for the gift of His Beloved Son and for the hope that it give me. With His help, I know that I can change and become better and some day be like Him and live with Him forever. Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift!</description>

      <description>We started a tradition years ago when we were first married. We wanted to make birthdays special. We had our children choose their favorite meals and flavor of cake for their special day. We had gifts and also went around the family and told the person whose birthday it was why we loved them. Everyone loved and looked forward to their special day! As time passed we realized that we needed to do the same for the Savior (an important member of our family).</description>

      <description>A good friend of ours came across this video on Facebook. Watch this 4 year old boy recite the Christ story as recorded in Luke. Amazing!! (and very cute too).

      <description>We enjoyed decorating our window as a family while we watched a past Tabernacle Choir Christmas concert. May it bring some peace and light to those near building 11A! Merry Christmas!!</description>

      <description>I love seeing the beautiful nativities that people display this time of year. While admiring one of my daughters nativities I noticed how our 5 year old granddaughter, Riley, quietly and on her own gave baby Jesus a tender heartfelt gift of one of her stuffed animals and a toy block with her initial on it, both beloved possessions. This expression of love and giving made me ask myself the question: What am I giving to my Savior?</description>
